Engineering Studies takes a lot of time, this is why my professional experience is a bit poor for now. Moreover i did an internship during the summer holydays in 2021 that brought me a lot of knowledge.



# Topics of my internship

The purpose of my internship was to study the advancement of recent technologies in the field of transportation and supply chain.
These two subjects were blockchain and Artificial Intelligence. The one that i learned the most is about blockchain, because it is a vast subject and also because it is a technology that can be applied to a lot of fields of work. Unfortunately, It is often mistaken with bitcoin, which is a cryptocurrency that uses this technology. I also learned a lot about how to popularize a technology, because it is extremely hard to explain hard coding stuff to a truck driver.

# What i will remember about it

It is extremely important when you work with a team to show each other the progression of what you have done to be able to meet the dealines.
